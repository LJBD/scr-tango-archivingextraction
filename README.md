# scr-tango-archivingextraction
This repository contains simple scripts for direct extraction of data from a Tango Control System archiving database.

THIS PROJECT IS IN A VERY EARLY PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT!
The goal is to provide Mambo-like features but with a different, Python, back- and front-end.
For now, this module can be used to:
  - extract data (and plot it) for an attribute (or a group of them) between given dates
  - extract all attributes that are archived
  - plot a histogram of differences between timestamps of consecutive values
